# Cornell Systems Engineering Coursework

## Description
This repo contains the coursework content completed in partial fulfillment for the requirements of the PhD in Systems Engineering at Cornell University in 2022.

All documents are implemented in LaTeX. The PDF's can be complied from the source through the path ``../src/`` or accessed directly through the path ``../pdf/`` for each folder: ``sysen/6150/``, ``sysen/6000/``, ``sysen/8100/``. 

The material in each folder contains only regular assignments (not containing midterm or final projects) corresponding to the following, where all instructor annotations have been omitted.
